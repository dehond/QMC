    "We often construct a basis for a large Hilbert space consisting out of a bunch of smaller Hilbert spaces (for example when dealing with a number of coupled two-level systems). Take, for instance, two two-level atoms. When we construct the Hamiltonian we usually employ tensor products to get the total Hamiltonian from the individual two-level matrices. It is important that we construct the state vectors in the same way. When the time comes to specify an initial state, for instance, it may be attractive to simpy use the `basis()` command to do the following to have all atoms in the ground state:"
